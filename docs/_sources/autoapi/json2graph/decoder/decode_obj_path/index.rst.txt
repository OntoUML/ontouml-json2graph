.. py:function:: set_path_path_point(path_dict, ontouml_graph)

   Creates an ontouml:Point, their properties and the ontouml:point of an ontouml:Path.

   :param path_dict: Path object loaded as a dictionary.
   :type path_dict: dict
   :param ontouml_graph: Knowledge graph that complies with the OntoUML Vocabulary.
   :type ontouml_graph: Graph


.. py:function:: create_path_properties(json_data, ontouml_graph)

   Main function for decoding an object of type Path.

   Receives the whole JSON loaded data as a dictionary and manipulates it to create all properties in which the
   object's type is domain of.

   Created instances of:
       - ontouml:Point

   Created properties:
       - ontouml:point (range ontouml:Point)

   :param json_data: JSON's data to have its fields decoded loaded into a dictionary.
   :type json_data: dict
   :param ontouml_graph: Knowledge graph that complies with the OntoUML Vocabulary.
   :type ontouml_graph: Graph
