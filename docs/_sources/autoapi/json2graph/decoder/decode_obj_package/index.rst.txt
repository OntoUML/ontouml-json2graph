===============================================

.. py:module:: json2graph.decoder.decode_obj_package

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Functions to decode specificities of the object Package.

   Function's nomenclatures:
       - Functions that set one property are named: set_<subject>_<predicate>_<object>.
       - Functions that set multiple object properties are named: set_<subject>_relations.
       - Functions that set multiple data properties are named: set_<subject>_attributes.
       - Functions that set both object and data properties are named: set_<subject>_properties.
       - Functions that set default values: set_<subject>_defaults.

.. py:function:: get_package_contents(package_dict, package_id, list_contents = [])

   Receives the dictionary with all loaded JSON data and returns the value of the 'contents' field for a given
   object (defined by the received value of its ID).

   :param package_dict: Package's data to have its fields decoded.
   :type package_dict: dict
   :param package_id: ID of the Package to have its list of contents returned.
   :type package_id: str
   :param list_contents: Optional. Used to identify if the desired value was already found and exit recursion.
   :type list_contents: list
   :return: List of contents for a given Package.
   :rtype: list[dict]


.. py:function:: set_package_containsmodelelement_modelelement(package_dict, ontouml_graph)

   Set object property ontouml:containsModelElement between an ontouml:Package and an ontouml:ModelElement it
   contains.

   :param package_dict: Package's data to have its fields decoded.
   :type package_dict: dict
   :param ontouml_graph: Knowledge graph that complies with the OntoUML Vocabulary.
   :type ontouml_graph: Graph


.. py:function:: create_package_properties(json_data, ontouml_graph)

   Main function for decoding an object of type Package.

   Receives the whole JSON loaded data as a dictionary and manipulates it to create all properties in which the
   object's type is domain of.

   Created object properties:
       - ontouml:containsModelElement (range:ModelElement)

   :param json_data: JSON's data to have its fields decoded loaded into a dictionary.
   :type json_data: dict
   :param ontouml_graph: Knowledge graph that complies with the OntoUML Vocabulary.
   :type ontouml_graph: Graph
