.. py:module:: json2graph.decoder.decode_obj_generalizationset

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Functions to decode specificities of the object GeneralizationSet.

   Function's nomenclatures:
       - Functions that set one property are named: set_<subject>_<predicate>_<object>.
       - Functions that set multiple object properties are named: set_<subject>_relations.
       - Functions that set multiple data properties are named: set_<subject>_attributes.
       - Functions that set both object and data properties are named: set_<subject>_properties.
       - Functions that set default values: set_<subject>_defaults.

.. py:function:: set_generalizationset_defaults(generalizationset_dict, ontouml_graph)

   Sets the default values to ontouml:generalizationSets to the resulting graph.

   - Default isDisjoint: If isDisjoint is null, set as False.
   - Default isComplete: If isComplete is null, set as False.

   :param generalizationset_dict: GeneralizationSet object loaded as a dictionary.
   :type generalizationset_dict: dict
   :param ontouml_graph: Knowledge graph that complies with the OntoUML Vocabulary.
   :type ontouml_graph: Graph


.. py:function:: set_generalizationset_relations(generalizationset_dict, ontouml_graph)

   Sets the ontouml:generalization and ontouml:categorizer property to the resulting graph.

   :param generalizationset_dict: GeneralizationSet object loaded as a dictionary.
   :type generalizationset_dict: dict
   :param ontouml_graph: Knowledge graph that complies with the OntoUML Vocabulary.
   :type ontouml_graph: Graph


.. py:function:: create_generalizationset_properties(json_data, ontouml_graph)

   Main function for decoding an object of type GeneralizationSet.

   Receives the whole JSON loaded data as a dictionary and manipulates it to create all properties in which the
   object's type is domain of.

   Created properties:
       - ontouml:generalization (range ontouml:Generalization)
       - ontouml:categorizer (range ontouml:Class)

   :param json_data: JSON's data to have its fields decoded loaded into a dictionary.
   :type json_data: dict
   :param ontouml_graph: Knowledge graph that complies with the OntoUML Vocabulary.
   :type ontouml_graph: Graph
