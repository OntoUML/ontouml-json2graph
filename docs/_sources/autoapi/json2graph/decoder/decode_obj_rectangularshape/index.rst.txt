.. py:module:: json2graph.decoder.decode_obj_rectangularshape

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Functions to decode specificities of the object RectangularShare.

   Function's nomenclatures:
       - Functions that set one property are named: set_<subject>_<predicate>_<object>.
       - Functions that set multiple object properties are named: set_<subject>_relations.
       - Functions that set multiple data properties are named: set_<subject>_attributes.
       - Functions that set both object and data properties are named: set_<subject>_properties.
       - Functions that set default values: set_<subject>_defaults.

.. py:function:: set_rectangularshape_coordinates(rectangularshape_dict, ontouml_graph)

   Creates an ontouml:Point, their properties and the ontouml:topLeftPosition of an ontouml:RectangularShape.

   :param rectangularshape_dict: RectangularShape object loaded as a dictionary.
   :type rectangularshape_dict: dict
   :param ontouml_graph: Knowledge graph that complies with the OntoUML Vocabulary.
   :type ontouml_graph: Graph


.. py:function:: create_rectangularshape_properties(json_data, ontouml_graph)

   Main function for decoding an object of type RectangularShape.

   Receives the whole JSON loaded data as a dictionary and manipulates it to create all properties in which the
   object's type is domain of.

   Created instances of:
       - ontouml:Point

   Created properties:
       - ontouml:topLeftPosition (domain ontouml:RectangularShape, range ontouml:Point)
       - ontouml:xCoordinate (domain ontouml:Point, range xsd:integer)
       - ontouml:yCoordinate (domain ontouml:Point, range xsd:integer)

   # The ontouml:height and ontouml:width data properties are not assigned in this function, as they can be directly
   obtained in the general decoding.

   :param json_data: JSON's data to have its fields decoded loaded into a dictionary.
   :type json_data: dict
   :param ontouml_graph: Knowledge graph that complies with the OntoUML Vocabulary.
   :type ontouml_graph: Graph
