:py:mod:`json2graph.decode`
===========================

.. py:module:: json2graph.decode

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   It provides a convenient interface for converting OntoUML JSON files into knowledge graphs,
   with the flexibility to customize the output and control the execution mode for different use cases.

   Usage:
   1. Standalone Execution:
       When this module is executed as a standalone script:
       - The user can provide arguments via the command line to control the conversion process.
       - The `ontouml_json2graph` function is called with the provided arguments for the transformation.

   2. Library Usage:
       This module can be used as a library by importing and calling the `ontouml_json2graph` function directly
       with appropriate parameters.

   Note:
   - Ensure that the required OntoUML JSON file is available before executing the transformation.

.. py:function:: ontouml_json2graph(json_path, base_uri = 'https://example.org#', graph_format = 'ttl', language = '', model_only = False, silent = True, correct = False, execution_mode = 'import')

   Main function for converting OntoUML JSON data to a Knowledge Graph.

   This function takes the path to a JSON file representing OntoUML model data provided by the user
   and converts it into a knowledge graph following the specified options.

   :param json_path: Path to the JSON file to be decoded provided by the user.
   :type json_path: str
   :param base_uri: Base URI to be used for generating URIs for ontology concepts.
   Default is "https://example.org#". (Optional)
   :type base_uri: str
   :param graph_format: Format for saving the resulting knowledge graph.
   Default value is 'ttl' (Turtle syntax). (Optional)
   :type graph_format: str
   :param language: Language tag to be added to the ontology's concepts. (Optional)
   :type language: str
   :param model_only: If True, only the OntoUML model will be extracted without diagrammatic information. (Optional)
   :type model_only: bool
   :param silent: If True, suppresses intermediate communications and log messages during execution. (Optional)
   :type silent: bool
   :param correct: If True, attempts to correct potential errors during the conversion process. (Optional)
   :type correct: bool
   :param execution_mode: Information about the execution mode.
   Valid values are 'import' (default), 'script', and 'test'. (Optional)
   :type execution_mode: str
   :return: Saved output file path. Used for testing.
   :rtype: str
