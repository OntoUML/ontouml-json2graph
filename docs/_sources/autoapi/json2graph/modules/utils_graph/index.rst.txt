.. py:function:: ontouml_ref(entity)

   Receive the name of the OntoUML Vocabulary's entity as a string and returns the corresponding URIRef.

   :param entity: OntoUML Vocabulary entity (class, property, or individual) to have its URIRef returned.
   :type entity: str
   :return: URIRef of the informed OntoUML Vocabulary's entity.
   :rtype: URIRef


.. py:function:: load_ontouml_vocabulary(enable_remote = False)

   Load the OntoUML Vocabulary to the working memory.

   If the argument enable_remote is enabled (i.e., equals True), it first tries to load from web resource, if fails,
   it tries to load form the local resource. If both options fail, calls error reporting function.

   If the argument enable_remote is disabled, the function tries to load form the local resource and if fails,
   it calls the error reporting function.

   The enable_remote is disabled by default as it can significantly decrease the software performance.
   However, using it can guarantee that the most recent version of vocabulary is always used.

   :param enable_remote: Controls if the software will try to get the ontouml vocabulary ttl file from a remote source.
   :type enable_remote: bool
   :return: RDFLib graph loaded as object.
   :rtype: Graph


.. py:function:: load_graph_safely(ontology_file, format = 'not_provided')

   Safely load graph from file to working memory using arguments provided by the user, which are the file path     and (optionally) the file type.

   :param ontology_file: Path to the ontology file to be loaded into the working memory.
   :type ontology_file: str
   :param format: Optional argument. Format of the file to be loaded.
   :type format: str
   :return: RDFLib graph loaded as object.
   :rtype: Graph
