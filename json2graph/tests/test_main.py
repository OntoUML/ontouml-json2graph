""" OntoUML JSON2Graph Test Module.

This module contains test functions to verify the correctness of the OntoUML JSON2Graph software.
The tests are based on the comparison of the generated graph (from OntoUML JSON files provided in the test folder)
with the expected resulting graph stored in Turtle (.ttl) files (also provided in the test folder).

The module uses a list of test files (`LIST_OF_TESTS`) retrieved from the function `get_test_list()`.
Each test file is a valid OntoUML JSON file representing a model.

The comparison of graphs is done using the function `compare_graphs`, which should be defined and available
for the tests to run successfully.

The tests will ensure the correct functioning of the OntoUML JSON2Graph software and raise an assertion error
if the generated graph does not match the expected graph.
